# CarpetGripperCalculator
simple calculator to work out how much gripper is required in a specific area.


Simply enter area length and area width as arguments, the programme will return the amount of gripper required.

Please send pull requests I am new to programming and want to learn by doing and making mistakes, I would like to see other approaches to this simple programme.

At present I have not learned how to ask for user input so this can obviously only be used as a personal tool on the ide.
